/**
 * This is a new feature of Java, called a "functional interface";
 * it defines a lambda type that means we can pass in a three-argument
 * method (instance or static) as a parameter to the StockMarket
 * constructor. See the StockPublisher code for an example.
 * 
 * In general, "function parameters" like this are a powerful way
 * to combine functionality without using traditional inheritance--in
 * essence, you are "customizing" the behavior of the recipient
 * by passing that functionality in as a parameter.

/**
 * A StockMarket spends its time doing two different things:
 * one, thinking (essentially sleeping), and two, changing a stock
 * ticker symbol to a new value. Note that a given SMT will only
 * change stocks for a small set of companies/symbols. It will be
 * assumed that no other SMTs represent the same set of symbols (yet).
